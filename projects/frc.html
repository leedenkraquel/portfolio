<br /><p>On this project, I was the lead of electronics and electrical systems. My responsibilities included developing and maintaining the electronics on board the robot, which included all the processors, power distribution devises, sensors, actuators, and power sources. Being of the most significant subsystem of the project, I collaborated with the leads from all the other subsystems to encorporate the electrical system into their work. This included maintaining proper power distribution to all actuators, I/O configuration, and sensor testing for accurate active measurements on board the robot.
