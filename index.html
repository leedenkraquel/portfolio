Often people see projects in just the light of school projects. However, projects bleed through schooling into the workforce in nearly every career. Making a new billboard design, introducing a bug fix in a program, or performing a mass sanitization of a workspace, can all be considered projects. For the scope of software engineering, a project is usually considered to be the end product that is delivered to the consumer. The project is often built up in the form of many smaller tasks, these tasks may be small, but there are often an extremely large number of them. The amount of time it would take a single person to complete all these tasks is simply not efficient. Instead, most projects are handled by a group. But, the problem with working as a group is the coordination and organization required to accomplish the goal well. </p><div class="labels_section"><p class="label">Software Engineering</p><p class="label">Project Management</p><p class="label">Ethics</p></div></div></a><a class="essay_link" href="essays/design-patterns.html"><div class="essay_card"><p class="title">Importance of Design Patterns</p><p class="date">2021-04</p><p class="summary">Many software developers and engineers know that there are a few guidelines that should be followed when making a program. These include things like formatting, coding style, and design patterns. These are just some of the many properties that programmers keep in mind when making their programs. Although there are many, this essay will discuss design patterns, what they are, why they are useful, and some examples.</p><div class="labels_section"><p class="label">Software Engineering</p></div></div></a><a class="essay_link" href="essays/ui-development.html"><div class="essay_card"><p class="title">Who uses UI?</p><p class="date">2021-02</p><p class="summary">This is a webpage, and a rather basic one at it. Many people who peruse the web rarely see a webpage that looks like this because people who develop webpages usually have standards for themselves. Webpages are known to look much better than this and have much more color, style, attitude, and pazzazz. Take Google.com for example. This webpage is often a simple webpage but on rather frequent occasions becomes a digital mural to some day, person, or event. This is what is known as UI design. A user-interface design, made to interact with the user. However, if you've ever tried to make a webpage yourself, a simple website like the Google has made famous is not necessarily a simple task.</p><div class="labels_section"><p class="label">Software Engineering</p><p class="label">UI</p><p class="label">Web Design</p></div></div></a></div>
